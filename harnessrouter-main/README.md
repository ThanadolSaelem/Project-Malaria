![N × M harness integrations → 1 unified interface](docs/images/harnessrouter-one-agent-api-live-comparison.gif)

HarnessRouter Community Edition gives your product one consistent, OpenAI Responses-compatible
interface for running supported agent harnesses. It handles tasks and runs, sessions, streaming,
files, artifacts, cancellation, recovery, structured errors, and traces, so your product does not
need a separate backend integration for every harness.

### One interface. The freedom to choose.

<a href="https://harnessrouter.ai/benchmarks" title="Across many tasks, we have seen cost savings above 90%. In some cases, lower-cost configurations were also faster.">
  <img src="docs/images/benchmark-summary.svg" width="100%" alt="One recorded task, eight Harness × Model configurations. Save 99.8%: cost 0.47–223 credits; latency 1m 25s–4m 36s. Cost and latency vary by task. See the benchmark.">

**Open source and self-hosted.** Community Edition is the Apache 2.0 reference implementation of
[Unified Harness Protocol (UHP)](https://unifiedharnessprotocol.org). It packages the Console, Gateway, and Runner in one
Docker deployment, with provider keys, state, and files on infrastructure you control.

## Quickstart

Start HarnessRouter with one Docker command. On the first launch, HarnessRouter installs the
supported harness CLIs you enable, so wait until the logs show `ready on :3000`. Then open the
console, connect a model provider, and run your first task.

### What you need

- Docker
- About 4 GB of disk space
- An API key from a supported model provider

No HarnessRouter account is required for Community Edition.

### 1. Start HarnessRouter

```bash
docker run -d --name harnessrouter \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v harnessrouter:/data \
  harnessrouter/harnessrouter
```

Docker pulls the image automatically if it is not already present. The named volume keeps your
database, files, installed harness CLIs, and workspaces between restarts.

If port 3000 is busy, use `-p 127.0.0.1:3100:3000` and open port 3100 instead. Keep the
loopback binding while using the initial credentials. Do not add `--user`: the container starts
as root to establish per-session users, then runs the product and agents without root privileges.

For version pinning, Docker Compose, and scripted setup, see the
[setup and operations guide](docs/self-hosting-guide.md#install).

### 2. Wait for the first launch

```bash
docker logs -f harnessrouter
```

The first launch takes longer while the enabled harness CLIs are installed. Continue when the logs
show:

```text
[harnessrouter] ready on :3000
```

### 3. Open the console

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with the initial local credentials:

| | |
|---|---|
| Username | `harnessrouter` |
| Password | `harnessrouter` |

Change the password from **Profile** now. Saving briefly restarts the Console and signs out other
browsers. If you configured `HR_AUTH_USER` or `HR_AUTH_PASSWORD`, use those credentials instead.
Keep the instance local until you have changed the default password.

<summary>See the sign-in screen</summary>

</details>

### 4. Connect a model provider

Open **Integrations**, select **Add Integration**, choose a provider, and add its API key. Provider
requests follow the provider and credentials you choose.

Give the integration a name. There is no bundled model or trial key: a compatible provider must
be connected before a task can run. Its supported models then become available in the Console.

![Adding a model provider in HarnessRouter](docs/images/05-add-integration.png)

### 5. Run your first task

Open **Agent harnesses**, choose a supported harness, and select **New task**. Choose an available
model and give the agent something concrete to do. Progress streams into the same task while files,
artifacts, errors, and the final result remain attached to its session.

## Starter kits

Plug agent harnesses into your own interface to power tasks far beyond coding. To help you explore
what’s possible, we created starter kits for presentations, spreadsheets, dashboards, and videos.
More kits will be added over time.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

[Explore the Starter Kits repository →](https://github.com/HarnessRouter/starter-kit)

Launch a kit from **Starter Kits** in the Console and select a harness and model supported by your
connected providers. Sheets agent columns require another agent to run. Dashboards require a
reachable database, a read-only database account, and `HR_SECRET_KEY` for stored connections;
review the sample-row setting before connecting. Video generation incurs additional per-clip costs.
See the [kit setup details](docs/self-hosting-guide.md#starter-kits) before launching.

## One interface for the agent lifecycle

Your product integrates once with HarnessRouter instead of rebuilding the same lifecycle for each
harness.

| Contract | What your product receives |
|---|---|
| Tasks and runs | One way to start work and inspect its status |
| Sessions | Continuity across turns and resumable work |
| Streaming | Live progress and server-sent events |
| Files and artifacts | Structured inputs and retrievable finished work |
| Cancellation and recovery | Consistent controls when work changes or fails |
| Errors and traces | Structured failure details and a reviewable execution record |

Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, DeepSeek Harness, and a growing set of supported harnesses sit behind
this shared contract. The available catalog is shown by the running instance, so adding support does
not require your product backend to adopt another harness-specific interface.

## Use the API directly

The Console is a client of the same OpenAI Responses-compatible API your application uses. Sign in
once to keep a local session cookie, then run a turn:

```bash
curl -s -c hr.cookies http://localhost:3000/api/selfhost/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"harnessrouter","password":"<your-password>"}'

curl -s -b hr.cookies http://localhost:3000/api/harness/v1/responses \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "input":"Reply with exactly: it works.",
    "metadata":{"harness_id":"codex"},
    "model":"gpt-5.4-mini",
    "stream":false
  }'
```

The task appears in the Console with the same session and transcript. Set `"stream": true` to
receive server-sent events.

## Why self-host Community Edition

- **Your infrastructure.** Console, Gateway, and Runner ship as one self-contained Docker deployment.
- **Your credentials and state.** Provider keys, sessions, files, and workspaces remain under your control. Model requests still go to the provider you configure.
- **Real workspaces.** Harnesses run with their native filesystem, shell, and Git workflows.
- **No separate harness backends.** Your application keeps one Task, Run, Session, File, Artifact, Error, and Trace contract as support grows.
- **A path to hosted scale.** Community Edition and HarnessRouter Cloud implement the same UHP contract.

## The Unified Harness Protocol

[Unified Harness Protocol (UHP)](https://unifiedharnessprotocol.org) is the public, versioned contract
implemented by Community Edition and HarnessRouter Cloud. This repository contains the Apache 2.0
reference implementation, machine-readable schemas, and the conformance suite.

| Resource | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Specification](protocol/versions/2026-08-11/) | Normative protocol behavior |
| [OpenAPI and JSON Schema](protocol/schema/) | Machine-readable contracts |
| [Conformance suite](protocol/conformance/) | Testable compatibility requirements |
| [Governance](protocol/GOVERNANCE.md) | How the standard evolves |

## Architecture

│  /data volume    database · files · secrets · workspaces           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Sessions have separate workspaces and conversation state. The Gateway and Runner listen on
loopback inside the container; the Console is the entry point for both the UI and API.
